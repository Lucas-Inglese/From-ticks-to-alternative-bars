# From Ticks to Alternative Bars

This repository is designed to guide you through the process of transforming raw tick data into alternative bar types using MetaTrader 5 (MT5) and advanced methods from the literature.

## Overview

The process is divided into three main stages:

1. **Importing Ticks via MT5 (Folder 1)**: In this stage, you'll learn how to import raw tick data directly from MetaTrader 5.

2. **Cleaning the Data (Folder 2)**: The imported tick data is then cleaned using the methods discussed in the paper "Financial Econometric Analysis at Ultra–High Frequency: Data Handling Concerns" by Christian T. Brownlees and Giampiero M. Gallo. This step ensures that the data is suitable for further analysis and transformation.

3. **Transforming Ticks into Alternative Bars (Folder 3)**: Finally, the cleaned tick data is transformed into various alternative bar types (e.g., volume bars, dollar bars, etc.), as described in Marco Lopez de Prado's book. This step is crucial for creating more robust trading strategies based on different data representations.
